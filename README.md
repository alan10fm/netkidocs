Deliver the fast and easy experience customers demand, while decreasing fraud risk.

OnboardID is the leading solution for both individual and corporate onboarding.

## OnboardID Solutions

Netki covers the most common range of devices and mechanisms for KYC/AML solutions. We have taken our cutting edge flagship application `MyVerify` and made those algorithms available as downloadable SDKs.


Our suite of products covers the following application strategies:

- Android SDK native in Java and Kotlin
- iOS SDK native in Objective-C and Swift
- React Native wrapper
- iframe based Web SDK
- API interface

## OnboardID SDKs

We offer a full featured SDK for OnboardID.  The SDK will provide your engineering team with the components necessary for you to send your users through a custom KYC onboarding flow of your design within your own mobile application or web portal.

After setting up an account with us we will send you onboarding information. It normally takes a few days to build around our SDK with the biggest consumption of time coming from the consumption of the data that we will send you. It is a lot of data to digest.  You may refer to the [API Access](#onboardid-api-access) to learn more about how our APIs work.

## OnboardID API Access

Nearly all our clients will interact with our API.  While not all clients will use more than one of the SDKs, it is important to plan ahead to integrate with the API.  Your data will return via callbacks and you are also encouraged to poll the API to check to see if new records have showed up or there are changes to records that are currently in processing.
